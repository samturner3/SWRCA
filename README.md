Fire up your local server, 
make a new database "user_registration",
import the .sql file from git into database,
browse to index.php to get the login screen (does nothing atm),
then click profiles in top  bar (profile2.php) to view animal profiles.

You can test by adding or editing the table 'animals' in the database and the web page should reflect any changes.
